## 3VOT is a full production line for (100% browser based) JS Apps  
Browser Apps are the cool apps that require no page refresh, exists only in the browser, no server, no click an wait. Also known as Single Page Apps (SPApps) and made famous by Facebook & Twitter. 

With 3VOT junior developers can build SPApps with their favorite frameworks, while advanced developers can write their own using modular code. It is 100% Open, does not impose anything and GOYW (gets out of your way)

###It includes:
- Development Enviroment
- Command Line Interface
- Static Cloud
- App Repository

#### With 3VOT you can build standard HTML/JS Apps in your prefared way
Build Apps using standard technologies, with your favorite frameworks, pre-procesors and automation tools.

#### Upload Apps to the Static Cloud
Where and how long does it take to publish an app to the web or roll back to a previus version. How do you preview one version to your team or customers? <br/>

With 3VOT with each time you do ```3vot upload```, you'll upload a new version of the app and get a link to share with anyone. Nothing to think about, it just works.

#### Publish Apps to the Static Cloud
How do you scale your app for a spike, or make sure that server will run forever. Cache, DNS, CDN?

**Why publish a static JS App to a server? Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc; Those are for dynamic client-server apps.**

3VOT has the only cloud for Frontend Static Apps. It will scale for 10 to 10 million users, it's super affordable and it needs only one command ```3vot publish```. 3VOT provides your with a link, that will always be your production app and you'll be able to select what  version of your app is live.

#### Deploy or Embeed an App 
Building a state of the art SPApp and deploying it via an iFrame is like watching a blue ray movie on your grandfather's old TV Box. <br/>

With 3VOT you can insert a ```<scrpt src="MY_3VOT_APP">``` tag anywhere on the web, and the app will render itself there.

#### Clone an App
So you built an amazing app, and now you want to build a similar one. With 3VOT all you need to do is ```3vot download``` an app from our public repo or your private one.

This is how many organizations share examples apps and tutorials, one command and you got the app ready to run.

Large organizations or Agencies setup templates and base projects for training, standarization, mantainability. In short to power their 3VOT Production-Line of apps.

#### Write browser javascript the NODEJS Way
Being able to require("fs") dependencies and separate javascript code in modules is a revolution. 3VOT brings this revolution to the browser allowing developers to write modular code out of the box.

3VOT empowers you to build resusable components in plain javascript, separate your code in files and folders.

This opens up the door to writting enterprise large scale apps, real unit testing becomes posible and applying OOP Principles a reality.

#### Forget about servers
3VOT removes the neccesity, costs and complications of using servers to host static HTML/JS Apps; With 3VOT you build apps that can be deployed statically, no servers. 

3VOT offers the 3VOT Static Cloud that

## On the Shoulders of Giants ##

3VOT is built on top of lessons and/or code from the leading open source libraries and minds in the world. Special Recognition to Alex Maccaw for his vision and work on modular code with Spine and Hem Server Specially and to Substack's Unix Mentality and it's Browserify Open Source Library. The Amazing work by Visionmedia is all over the place in Express and SuperAgent. PLV8 powers ours backend thanks to mgutz concepts. Finally thanks to creationix for it's pair programming sessions.

Lessons learned while using Grunt and Yeoman definitely shaped 3VOT, but those projects are not used on the CLI.
