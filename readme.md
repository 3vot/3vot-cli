### 3VOT is a full production line for (100% browser based) JS Apps, it includes:
- JS Framework
- Command Line Interface
- Publishing Cloud
- Backend DB (comming soon!)

### It is an innovation on how we build Apps using Javascript

There is a new generation of Apps that are amazing, reactive, beautifull and with 3VOT posible. Give it a try and learn how simple it is to build modern Javascript Applications the modular, serverless, profesional way.


* 3VOT is a platform to **build Single Page Apps**, apps without page refresh, no click a wait!
* An **Open Source Cloud Infrastructure** to scale apps to over a hundread millions users
* The technology to write Enterprise Apps with **Javascript in Modules and Components**, the NodeJS way.
* The automation to instantly require **over 80,000 dependencies** and hundreds of Third Party Services.

**3VOT Browser Apps** Build standard html,css and js **browser apps** using Modular Code and Dependency Managment just like we write NodeJS Apps, but on the browser.

**3VOT is Serverless** we automated the way to pack Apps into Static Assets. There is no server to setup, configure, scale and worry about. There is no server, Apps are published on AWS S3 ultrascalable and hyperdependable Storage.

**3VOT Command Line Tools** automate the whole app development livecycle like installing depedencies, app versioning, downloading ( source code / base apps / templates / examples ) , uploading development versions, and publishing final production versions versions.

**Standalone or Embedded** 3VOT Apps can be deployed anywhere, as a Standalone App or embedded inside a traditional client-server app, a CMS, blog or static page.

**3VOT is Open** as a developer you can use the 3VOT for free to build robust JS Apps, you are free to choose your favorite framework, patterns and tools. No propietary lock-in.

**3VOT is an automated Production Line of Apps**, organizations can use it to take app development to next level. Automation, Standarization, Quality, Maintanability. Just like a production line of cars, 3VOT has robots that improve manual processes and let's your org reach farther.

###History###
Frontend Apps used to be build using the Client-Server model using servers like php, nodejs, .net and rails. Each action like a button required the loop to the server and the page needed to be refreshed. 

Modern frontend apps are called Single Page Applications. Think Facebook, where the page does not refresh when you Like or Share; 

Imagine your app behaving that way, it's possible. These Apps connect to a backend server or API via AJAX so each time something is saved or retrieved the page does not need to refresh, it just happends instantly. 

**Remember Single Page Apps are not the future, they are the present**

###The next Generation of Mobile First and Responsive###
They are good alternatives when you don't have the technology, but what if you could control a dedicated experience for each device, not a degraded for desktop or degraded for mobile, but awesome in both.

With 3VOT you can write an app in modules and components, and choose which components are loaded into each device depending on screen size and device features. Simple as that.

##The Production Line of Apps
3VOT was build as a full-fledged profesional production line and it has a command line tool to automated everything.

3VOT introduces the concept of version, each deployment is versioned so it's super simple to go back to old builds.

In the same way 3VOT introduces App Downloads, so you can download any version of an App and use it as a template for a new app. Your organization can set base proyects or templates that are already structured a standard way.

Dependency Managment is automated, so there is no worries about one developer working in one version of Jquery crasing with another one, integration is done automatically with every build.

Onbording new developers is simple, no enviroment to setup, everything is standard. Training is simple as well, you may create apps specifically for that and have new-comers download them. That's how with 3VOT junior developers can build enterprise apps.

## On the Shoulders of Giants ##

3VOT is built on top of lessons and/or code from the leading open source libraries and minds in the world. Special Recognition to Alex Maccaw for his vision and work on modular code with Spine and Hem Server Specially and to Substack's Unix Mentality and it's Browserify Open Source Library. The Amazing work by Visionmedia is all over the place in Express and SuperAgent. PLV8 powers ours backend thanks to mgutz concepts. Finally thanks to creationix for it's pair programming sessions.

Lessons learned while using Grunt and Yeoman definitely shaped 3VOT, but those projects are not used on the CLI.
