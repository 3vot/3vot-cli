## History & Architecture ##
Browser Apps used to be build using the Client-Server model using servers like php, nodejs, .net and rails. Each action like a button required the loop to the server and the page needed to be refreshed to show the response.

Modern frontend apps are called Single Page Applications. Think Facebook, where the page does not refresh when you Like, Share or scroll to get more content.

Imagine your app behaving that way, it's possible. These Apps connect to a backend server or API via AJAX so each time something is saved or retrieved the page does not need to refresh, it happens instantly. 

**Remember Single Page Apps are not the future, they are the present**

## On the Shoulders of Giants ##

3VOT is built on top of lessons and/or code from the leading open source libraries and minds in the world. Special Recognition to Alex Maccaw for his vision and work on modular code with Spine and Hem Server Specially and to Substack's Unix Mentality and it's Browserify Open Source Library. The Amazing work by Visionmedia is all over the place in Express and SuperAgent. PLV8 powers ours backend thanks to mgutz concepts. Finally thanks to creationix for it's pair programming sessions.

Lessons learned while using Grunt and Yeoman definitely shaped 3VOT, but those projects are not used on the CLI.
