## 3VOT is a full production line for (100% browser based) JS Apps  
Browser Apps are the cool apps that require no page refresh, exists only in the browser, no server, no click an wait. Also known as Single Page Apps (SPApps) and made famous by Facebook & Twitter. 

With 3VOT junior developers can build SPApps with their favorite frameworks, while advanced developers can write their own using modular code. It is 100% Open, does not impose anything and GOYW (gets out of your way)

###It includes:
- Development Enviroment
- Command Line Interface
- Static Cloud
- App Repository
- Backend DB(comming soon!)

#### With 3VOT you can build standard HTML/JS Apps in your prefared way
Build Apps using standard technologies, using your favorite frameworks, pre-procesors and automation tools.

#### Upload Apps to the Static Cloud
Where and how long does it take to publish an app to the web or roll back to a previus version. How do you preview the process to your team or customers? With 3VOT with each time you do ```3vot upload```, you'll upload a new version of app and get a link to share with anyone. Nothing to think about, it just works.

#### Publish Apps to the Static Cloud
How do you scale your app for a spike, or make sure that server will run forever. Cache, DNS, CDN?

Why publish a static JS App to a server? Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc; Those are for dynamic client-server apps. 3VOT has the only cloud for Frontend Static Apps. It will scale for 10 or 10 million users, it's super affordable and it takes only one command ```3vot publish```

#### Deploy or Embeed an App 
Building a state of art SPApp and deplying it via an iFrame is like watching a blue ray movie on your grandfather's old TV Box. With 3VOT you can insert a <script src="MY_3VOT_APP"> tag anywhere on the web, and the app will render itself there.

#### Clone an App
So you built an amazing app, and now you want to build a similar one. With 3VOT all you need to do is ```3vot download``` an app from our public repo or your private one.

This is how many organizations share examples apps and tutorials, one command and you got the app ready to run.

Large organizations or Agencies setup templates and base projects for training, standarization, mantainability. In short to power their 3VOT Production-Line of apps.

#### Write browser javascript the NODEJS Way
Being able to require("fs") dependencies and separate javascript code in modules is a revolution. 3VOT brings this revolution to the browser allowing developers to write modular code out of the box.

3VOT empowers you to build resusable components in plain javascript, separate your code in files and folders.

This opens up the door to writting enterprise large scale apps, real unit testing becomes posible and applying OOP Principles a reality.

#### Forget about servers
3VOT removes the neccesity, costs and complications of using servers to host static HTML/JS Apps; With 3VOT you build apps that can be deployed statically, no servers. 

3VOT offers the 3VOT Static Cloud that


**3VOT is Serverless** we automated the way to pack Apps into Static Assets. There is no server to setup, configure, scale and worry about. There is no server, Apps are published on AWS S3 ultrascalable and hyperdependable Storage.

###History###
Frontend Apps used to be build using the Client-Server model using servers like php, nodejs, .net and rails. Each action like a button required the loop to the server and the page needed to be refreshed. 

Modern frontend apps are called Single Page Applications. Think Facebook, where the page does not refresh when you Like or Share; 

Imagine your app behaving that way, it's possible. These Apps connect to a backend server or API via AJAX so each time something is saved or retrieved the page does not need to refresh, it just happends instantly. 

**Remember Single Page Apps are not the future, they are the present**

###The next Generation of Mobile First and Responsive###
They are good alternatives when you don't have the technology, but what if you could control a dedicated experience for each device, not a degraded for desktop or degraded for mobile, but awesome in both.

With 3VOT you can write an app in modules and components, and choose which components are loaded into each device depending on screen size and device features. Simple as that.

##The Production Line of Apps
3VOT was build as a full-fledged profesional production line and it has a command line tool to automated everything.

3VOT introduces the concept of version, each deployment is versioned so it's super simple to go back to old builds.

In the same way 3VOT introduces App Downloads, so you can download any version of an App and use it as a template for a new app. Your organization can set base proyects or templates that are already structured a standard way.

Dependency Managment is automated, so there is no worries about one developer working in one version of Jquery crasing with another one, integration is done automatically with every build.

Onbording new developers is simple, no enviroment to setup, everything is standard. Training is simple as well, you may create apps specifically for that and have new-comers download them. That's how with 3VOT junior developers can build enterprise apps.

## On the Shoulders of Giants ##

3VOT is built on top of lessons and/or code from the leading open source libraries and minds in the world. Special Recognition to Alex Maccaw for his vision and work on modular code with Spine and Hem Server Specially and to Substack's Unix Mentality and it's Browserify Open Source Library. The Amazing work by Visionmedia is all over the place in Express and SuperAgent. PLV8 powers ours backend thanks to mgutz concepts. Finally thanks to creationix for it's pair programming sessions.

Lessons learned while using Grunt and Yeoman definitely shaped 3VOT, but those projects are not used on the CLI.
