There is a new generation of Apps that are amazing, reactive, beautifull and with 3VOT posible. Give it a try and learn how simple it is to build modern Javascript Applications the modular, profesional way.


* A Command Line Tool to build profesional Javascript Apps
* A Cloud Infrastructure to publish Apps and scale them to over a hundread millions of users
* The technology to build Enterprise Apps with Javascript in a Modular, maintanable way.
* The channel to reuse over 80,000 JS Libs and hundreds of Third Party Services.

**3VOT is Open** as a developer you can use the CLI for free to build robust JS Apps, you are free to choose your favorite framework, patterns and tools.

**3VOT is an automated Production Line of Apps**, organizations can use it to automate the production of apps. Just like a production line of cars, 3VOT has robots that improve manual processes and let's your org reach farther.

###History###
Back in the day web apps where build by an application server (php, nodejs, .net, rails) passed trought the server and page needed to be refreshed. 

To improve User Experience Single Page Apps where born. Frontend Servers like NodeJS and Rails made it possible to send web apps as a package that was loaded only once by the browser and interact from there on via AJAX with API Servers.

###Innovation###
With 3VOT you can build the same app with your favorite framework, but we don't need the server anymore **one less moving piece to worry about** and with 3VOT Cloud Architecture it's infinitly scalable. 3VOT apps are packaged as **just one file loaded to the browser, no HTTP requests** to any server!

Taking another step up we made it real easy to build Multiplatform Apps (Desktop,Tablet, Mobile) with only one set of code. 

###Server-Less Apps###
This opens up a world of opportunities, because we have innovated a way to build 100% Browser Apps with all the power and simplicity of NODEJS.
* Write browser code in modules
* Reuse code
* Installing Dependencies from NPM
* Deploy Standalone or Embbeded in Traditional Apps, Pages or CMS's

###Mission###
We build 3VOT looking to provide developers with a great experience, build and deployment actions are automated by one line command executed from the command-line with 3VOT-CLI and then published to 3VOT's Cloud.


##The Long Description##

**Build JS Apps that don't refresh using code from NPM & Github**
This results in Maintainable Apps that you can build 5X faster, reusing and writting less code. There is no Magic, standard HTML, CSS and JS, no propietary lock-in or restrictions on patterns, code or frameworks.

**Download Apps, Examples and Templates from The 3VOT App Store**
Most 3VOT Apps are Open Source and can be downloaded with one command. Use them as Tutorial, a Base Template or a really advanced starting point for your project.

**Publish Apps for free in 3VOT Cloud**
One Command to deploy production ready Apps, 3VOT is configured with CDN's, Cache and Analytics to handle millions of visits at top speeds. Easily deploy to 3VOT Cloud, your own 3VOT Cloud or your own servers.

**3VOT is a production line of Apps, use it to learn or to empower your demaning App Development Teams**

**Profesional Javascript Applications have the following features:**
* Standard HTML, JS & CSS without "Hacks" that everybody can understand top to bottom.
* No Page Refresh ( MVC Single Page Applications with no code-spaguetti )
* Modular Code ( written in modules, structured in files and folders )
* Multiplatform ( choose what code is loaded in Mobile, Tablet and Desktops  )
* Write Clean NodeJS Style code that runs in the browser
* Use NPM & Github Dependencies

**3VOT simplifes and unifies how we use the following technolgies**
* **Browserify:** Improves how we write and reuse code.
* **S3:** Publish Dynamic Single Page Javascript Apps **Statically** in Amazon S3 ( or anywhere else )
* **NPM:** Select from thousand dependencies and require them NODEJS Style

## On the Shoulders of Giants ##

3VOT is built on top of lessons and/or code from the leading open source libraries and minds in the world. Special Recognition to Alex Maccaw for his vision and work on modular code with Spine and Hem Server Specially and to Substack's Unix Mentality and it's Browserify Open Source Library. The Amazing work by Visionmedia is all over the place in Express and SuperAgent. PLV8 powers ours backend thanks to mgutz concepts. Finally thanks to creationix for it's pair programming sessions.

Lessons learned while using Grunt and Yeoman definitely shaped 3VOT, but those projects are not used on the CLI.
